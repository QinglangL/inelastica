STM-IMAGE SIMULATION

This example provides an STM-image calculation for a CO molecule adsorbed on a Cu(111) surface, scanned by a four-atom pyramidal Cu tip.

NOTE 1: STM calculations require a minimum vacuum gap of 5 Ang, i.e., the distance along the direction of transport between the most protruding substrate atom and the tip-apex atom.

NOTE 2: A relatively large lateral surface plane is in general required, as well as a dense k grid, in order to obtain reliable results. The minimal example included here however qualitatively reproduces the expected conductance dip over the CO molecule. 

NOTE 3: The calculated images are displayed with the default tip position at its center.


NEEDS: 	TotalPotential.grid.nc
       	Rho.grid.nc. 
Add the following lines in RUN.fdf for the TranSiesta calculation:
SaveTotalPotential true
SaveRho true

Partial STM images are saved as FDcurr[0-999].nc in respective k-point library [0-999] in the ./DestDir/. Wave functions and their derivatives, etc, are saved in the same way as FD[0-999].nc.
 
The k averaged STM image is saved in ./DestDir/STMimage.nc.

For Mathematica users, a Mathematica notebook (AnalyzeSTMimage.nb) is included to visualize the results saved in STMimage.nc.
